<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>My actual all time favorite movie. Watched it a lot when I was younger.</p>

<h3>The Little Princess</h3>
<p>This movie is so nice. About a girl who was sent to a boarding school her mother was in while her father was off to fight in the war.</p>

<h3>Logan</h3>
<p>LOL this was the first movie that really made me cry. The ending really got me. It was sooo good. RIP Wolverine</p>
